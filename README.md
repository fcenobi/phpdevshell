# PHPDevShell

This is a fresh repository for PHPDevShell as I'm working on it everyday.

Some fresh ressources:

- the new (but very incomplete) online manual on [Manula](http://www.manula.com/manuals/phpdevshell/phpdevshell/1/en/topic/introduction)
- help us translate the content on [POEditor](https://poeditor.com/projects/view?id=91995)
- the new bug tracker on [YouTrack](https://phpdevshell.myjetbrains.com/youtrack/dashboard)

Also IRC #phpdevshell on [Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net?channels=%23phpdevshell)
